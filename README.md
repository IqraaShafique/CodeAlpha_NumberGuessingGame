This C++ program is a console-based number guessing game that uses ANSI escape codes to change the console text color, enhancing the user experience with visually distinct messages. The game begins by displaying a welcome message and instructions. It then generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the built-in rand function, seeded with the current time to ensure randomness.

The main game loop prompts the player to enter their guess, counts the number of attempts, and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. This feedback is color-coded to make the experience more engaging. The loop continues until the player correctly guesses the secret number, at which point the program  displays the total number of guesses made. The game ends with a thank-you message and then terminates the window.
